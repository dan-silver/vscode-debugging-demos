## Debugging with Visual Studio Code

## Intro
* Dan Silver
    * github.com/dan-silver, dansil@microsoft.com
    * Works on Microsoft Graph (we ‚ù§ JS & TS)

* VS Code
    * "IDE" based on electron, cross platform, written in TypeScript
    * Doesn't share codebase with Visual Studio
    * Extendable with isolated API layer on top of Electron
    * Open source on GitHub
        * Public Roadmap - https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Roadmap
    * Monthly updates, just released 1.10 (with a minimap!)
    * Why does Microsoft invest in developer tools?

## Debugging Topics:
* Standard Node.js debugging
* Remote debugging with Chrome
* TypeScript support with source maps
* Multi-target debugging
* Column breakpoints
* Time travel debugging (with ChakraCore)

## If there's time at the end:
Other VS Code tricks:
* Hide files from sidebar (.vscode/settings.json then files.exclude)
* Insiders version - is it stable? benefits?
